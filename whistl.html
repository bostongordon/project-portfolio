        <h3>Lead Designer: Boston Gordon</h3>
        <p>Whistl is a mobile tool to help everyday people get involved in direct action activism.</p>

        <div class="singlecolumn">
          <h3>The Problem</h3>
          <p>Grassroots activism has relied on collectives of people to organize protests, boycotts, and petitions in order to further the causes of the people. There is no one place where the efforts of organizers and collectives can be found in oneplace so that eager individuals can find ways to get involved in political actions. I set out to design an all encompassing tool for citizens to get involved in direct actions to change their communities for the better.</p>
          <p>The solution was to create a user focused events application with a simple and visually pleasing search function so that everyday people can get directly involved in activism within their communities. Users can create profiles, find and favorite events, share events with friends, and create their own events as organizers on the platform.</p>

<section class="casestudy" id="User-Research">
      <div class="column">
        <h3>User Research</h3>
        <p>I created a user survey to capture how individuals felt about a direct action application.</p>
        <p>My results were telling. People are involved and want to be more involved during the current political moment.</p>
        <img class= chart src="images/WhistlChart.png" alt="Results of user research showing high participation in all actions">
        <p>Overwhelmingly participants said they were reccomended actions by friends.</p>
        <img class= chart src="images/WhistlChartTwo.png" alt="Image showing 97% of users heard about actions from friends">
        <p>Most participants said they would use a direct action application where they could find and share events and actions with friends.</p>

      <div class="column">
        <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
        <p>I compared Golden, Joulebug, and Deed.</p>
        <p>Each app has it's own specific focus. Golden and Deed connect organizations with people who want to get involved with volunteering. Joulebug helps individuals find ways to reduce their carbon impact.</p>

        <img class= compete src="images/LogosTwo.png" alt="Competitive Analysis Logos">
      </div>
      <div class="column">
        <p>The weaknesses of all these apps is that they are focused on one type of action that there is plenty of competition for. I wanted my app to be for organizers and individuals. For people who want to do actions from home or go out in the streets or volunteer with those in need. I wanted to take the same ideas and apply them to all the ways people use their actions, voices, money, and organizing to change the world.</p>

<section class="casestudy" id="User-Research">
      <div class="column">
        <h3>Personas</h3>
        <p>I created three different personas to capture the ecosystem of potential users.</p>
        <p>My first was a politically active high school history teacher who attends protests regularly. He represents an active and engaged pre-professional user.</p>
      </div>
        <div class="columntwo">
        <img class= personas src="images/UserOne.png" alt="User Persona One">
      </div>
      <div class="column">
        <p>My second persona is a former union organizer. They are highly politically motivated, organize volunteer causes, and attend protests and actions regularly. They represent an organizer level professional user.</p>
      </div>
        <div class="columntwo">
        <img class= personas src="images/UserTwo.png" alt="User Personas">
      </div>
      <div class="column">
        <p>My third persona is a twenty five year old who is not super politically active. She thinks that donating time and skills seems like the most accessible way for her to get involved authentically. She represents an entry level user.</p>
      </div>
        <div class="columntwo">
        <img class= personas src="images/UserThree.png" alt="User Personas">
      </div>
      <div class="column">
        <p>My product needed to account for this vast swath of people who would be interested in becoming regular users. It needed to be user friendly, secure, and encompass all the features a serious active user would want.</p>
      </div>

<section class="casestudy" id="User-Stories">
      <div class="column">
        <h3>User Stories and Flows</h3>
        <p>Based on the feedback from my user survey, my research of similar products, and the scope of my personas, I had a good idea of what actions my prototype would prioritize. My high priority user stories would encompass: Signing up for an account, searching for actions, seeing details of actions and organizers, saving actions, and viewing saved actions.</p>
        <p>I charted out and diagramed user flows for each of these user tasks in order to best organize how each task would be accomplished.</p>

<section class="casestudy" id="Prototypes">
      <div class="column">
        <h3>Prototypes and Testing</h3>
        <p>With these user tasks and flows and my audience in mind, I sketched iterations of what the app would look like. I focused on simple navigation, that way I had a simple map of how a user could get from signing up for an account to saving an action within minutes.</p>

        <p>I then completed lo-fi mockups of these designs so I could have my product shaped out and ready for branding.</p>

<section class="casestudy" id="Branding">
      <div class="column">
        <h3>Branding</h3>
        <p>Whistl is the call to users to get involved, engaged, and interested right now. The logo includes the name of the product with lines coming out the end like sound waves out of a bullhorn or whistle. The colors I chose suggest urgency: dark red, navy blue, and goldenrod yellow. Whistl uses Chivo typeface for headings, and Open Sans for paragraph text. This pairing creates a bold and distinctive look for the product.</p>

<section class="casestudy" id="Testing">
      <div class="column">
      <h3>Hi-fi Prototype and Testing</h3>
      <p>After applying my branding to my design, I tested my firstiterations of my hi-fi prototype on three users.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="column">
        <img class= screens src="images/WhistlHomepageOne.png" alt="Whistl Prototypes"
      </div>
      <div class="column">
      <p>I had each user create an account, perform a search function, and return to their homepage. All three users pointed out that checkboxes would be better than radio buttons for the second search page. One user was concerned that the white highlight on the navigation bar was hard to read. Overall the users were able to easily navigate through the app, but I made changes according to user feedback.</p>
    </div>
      <div class="column">
        <img class= screens src="images/BeforeAfterOne.png" alt="Whistl Prototypes"

        <img class= screens src="images/BeforeAfterTwo.png" alt="Whistl Prototypes"
      </div>
      <div class="column">
        <p>I added checkboxes to the search function, and changed the highlight color in the navigation bar from white to maroon. That way I could address user concerns and ensure accessbility.</p>
      </div>

<section class="casestudy" id="Conclusion">
        <div class="singlecolumn">
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>I feel confident that I succeeded in creating a product that is sleek, user friendly, and accomplishes the needs of users. A further developed product will include details on user settings, organizing events, and sharing actions with other users. I think ways for people to communicate with other users could be an advanced feature.</p>
          <p>Whistl stands out by providing an all in one product for users to find direct actions and easily have all the information about participating in them in one clean and secure place.</p>
