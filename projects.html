        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>My client reached out with a big idea in mind:</p>
        <p> “We're really excited at the possibilities we see in the cloud storage and organization market. Even with multiple big-name competitors in the space we feel like the market is still young and there's room for another player if we can find the right combination of features to meet the needs of a particular audience.”</p>
        <p>My solution was to create an interactive creative collaborative product for creatives to easily track drafts, chat, and collaborate with others.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="2col">
        <h3>User Research</h3>
        <p>The number one thing that users like about their current tools is the ability to collaborate in real time. Users also value tools that facilitate communication, easily keep them organized, maintain version control, and that they can access from anywhere.</p>
        <p>53% of users said they used cloud storage to collaborate with creative partners. That was my target audience - a large swath of the population using cloud based storage to make art and creative content.</p>

      <div class="2col">
        <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
        <p>I compared Dropbox, Box, and Degoo.</p>
        <p>All three attempt to solve the same problems. What Dropbox and Box lacked was a targeted focus on individual users and I knew that that was the direction I wanted my product to go in based on my survey results.</p>

        <h3>Personas</h3>
        <p>My personas encompassed creative professionals - from a GIS Specialist in need of a project presentation tool, to novelists working on the next draft of their book, to marketing professionals constantly creating content on a team of social media managers.</p>

        <h3>User Stories and Flows</h3>
        <p> My high priority user stories included:  Creating and uploading files, editing documents, storyboards, and presentations, sharing files with other users, organizing files via folders, saving different  drafts of files, and viewing these drafts in an organized manner.</p>
        <p>I charted out and diagramed user flows for each of these user tasks in order to best organize how each task would be accomplished. This helped me visualize the product’s efficiency and map out how users would progress through tasks.</p>

        <h3>Prototypes and Testing</h3>
        <p>I wanted to keep things clean with lots of white space, space that would make room for the creative projects of the targeted customer base.</p>
        <p>I tested the prototype on three users. All three users found some tasks simple to get through and some confusing. My biggest takeaway from the test was that I hadn’t created a clear path for people to organize the content once it has been added.</p>

      <div class="2col">
        <h3>Branding</h3>
        <p>Fizz would represent everything the product would offer: bubbling ideas, and big energy, social collaboration, the art of creation. The brand identity would use bold colors, clean fonts, and lots of white space to invoke these feelings.</p>

      <div class="2col">
        <h3>Hi-fi Prototype and Testing</h3>
        <p>I tested on three users again and found that while I had solved some of the clunkiness of the low-fidelity prototype I was still not landing on the mark.</p>
        <p>I revised the design to focus more on the drafting process and added more clean and clear layout to aid users in completing tasks easily and efficiently. I had focused on big bold images instead of the clean design I wanted to facilitate creativity.</p>

        <div class="1col">
          <h7>Conclusion</h7>
          <p>I feel confident that I succeeded in creating a product that is simple with the right tools to help people collaborate creatively. It is a solid product that can attract a base of creative consumers - just the folks who I was hoping to target. It’s clean, accessible, and has the tools that content creators use everyday to collaborate efficiently.</p>
